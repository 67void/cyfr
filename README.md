## Key Format:
```
at the  beginning of output:

wwwxyyyyyZ

www   = output language which its ciphered in [065,010,.--]
x     = A to Z (which cipher used)            [A-Z]
yyyyy = additional details                    []
Z     = proof of sign that its coded on cyfr  [Z]

at end of output:

ddmmyybbxxZ

dd    = date                                  [01-31]
mm    = month                                 [JA,FE,MA,AP,MY, JU,JY,AU,OC,NO,DE]
yy    = year                                  [00-99]
bb    = day                                   [MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA,ST]
xx    = which cipher used            [A-Z]
Z     = proof of sign that its coded on cyfr  [Z]
